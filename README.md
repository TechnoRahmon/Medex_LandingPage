# Redux Toolkit TypeScript Example

This example shows how to integrate Next.js with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org).

The **Redux Toolkit** is a standardized way to write Redux logic (create actions and reducers, setup the store with some default middlewares like redux devtools extension). This example demonstrates each of these features with Next.js
